# Machine-learning-in-R-Clustering-Algorithm
This K-means clustering Algorithm will create clusters of customers in a mall whose spending score is more so that they can target there marketing campaign.
I have uploaded the dataset where Mall has done analysis and came to conclusions on spending scores on different customers.
Using the spending score and annual income we will cluster the customers in different to target the customers and use them for marketing.
Here we can going to use R for our project.
